Now that you have done the formal GitHub tutorial at  https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/, it is time to try collaborating with me on GitHub.

Try the following: 

1) Navigate to sjech
2) Fork the repository Capstone_Git_Intro if you have not already.
3) Go back to your profile and see that you now have your own copy of this repo.
4) Open the file called "Do we 'git' it?"
5) Add a line with your name in it. 
6) Select ...

Add a line here with your name in it below:

For example, "Sierra really likes garden-fresh peas!"
